🎯 About
EcoTrack is an advanced IoT-powered dashboard designed for real-time monitoring and optimization of campus sustainability metrics. Built for the Build-Up Ideathon, this project demonstrates how technology can drive environmental consciousness and operational efficiency in educational institutions.
Problem Statement
Campuses lack real-time visibility into their resource consumption, leading to:

❌ Energy wastage and high utility costs
❌ Inefficient water usage and leaks going undetected
❌ Poor waste management and low recycling rates
❌ Unmonitored air quality affecting student health

Our Solution
EcoTrack provides a comprehensive monitoring system that:

✅ Tracks energy, water, waste, and air quality in real-time
✅ Generates smart alerts for anomalies and optimization opportunities
✅ Calculates sustainability scores and tracks improvements
✅ Monitors individual buildings for granular insights
✅ Integrates with affordable ESP32-based IoT sensors
